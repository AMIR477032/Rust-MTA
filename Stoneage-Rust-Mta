This project aims to bring elements and mechanics inspired by the game "Rust" by Facepunch Studios to Multi Theft Auto (MTA), a platform that allows the creation of mods and multiplayer servers for the game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. About the project The objective of this repository is to explore and integrate survival, construction and social interaction mechanics characteristic of the game "Rust" within the context of MTA. This includes the implementation of resource collection systems, base building, PvP (player versus player) and PvE (player versus environment) interactions, among others. Proposed features Survival System: Implementation of hunger, thirst, and protection against environmental threats mechanics. Structure Building: Create and fortify bases using resources lost in the game. Social Interaction: Facilitate interactions between players, including alliances and conflicts. Resource Economy: Manage and We use resources such as food, water and building materials. Repository Structure resources/: Additional resources, such as configuration files or assets necessary for the mods to work, also contains scripts and easy modifications to integrate the "Rust" functionalities into the MTA.
